# War Cards Game

### The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

### The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored

### Instructions: 
1. Clone repo and ``` cd ``` into it
2. Use ``` npm init ``` to install all dependencies
3. Run ``` npm run start ``` to begin the game
